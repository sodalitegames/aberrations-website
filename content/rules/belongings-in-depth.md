Equipment is defined as belongings that you can have on your person and are split into four categories: Weapons, Wearables, Consumables, and Usables. Whenever you acquire a new belonging, through whatever means, think through each of these to determine what it is.

1. Is its main purpose to fight? If yes, it is a Weapon.
2. Can I wear it? If yes, it is a Wearable.
3. Does it have limited uses? If yes, it is a Consumable.
4. Still here? Can you use it? If yes, it is a Usable.
5. Still here? If you can't use it, why do you even want it?

Objects that cannot fit on your person, such as vehicles, houses, and Grecian style fountains, are kept track of in your notes.

### Weapons

Weapons are belongings that you use to attack with.

You can have 2 Weapons equipped on your person at any given time. Any other Weapons you may have must be stored in your SURONIS and swapped out when needed.

Weapons are defined by a name, description, type, damage modifier, range, associated stat, and ability.

- **Name:** The name of the weapon that you use (shotgun, pistol, knife, hammer).
- **Description:** The physical description of the weapon. If your weapon is unique in any way, you can describe that here.
- **Type:** The classification of weapon that you use (Standard, Custom, Improvised). All the weapons listed in the [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks) are Standard Weapons.
- **Damage Modifier:** Damage Modifiers add a static number to the result of your roll when attacking with that weapon.
- **Range:** Every Weapon will have a minimum and maximum effective range. When attacking within this range, you roll as normal. For every space outside of the effective range you are attempting to hit, gain -1 Advantage to attack. Weapon ranges are listed as follows: Close (0 – 1 spaces), Short (2 – 4 spaces), Long (4 – 6 spaces), and Far (6 – 10 spaces).
- **Associated Stat:** The Associated Stat determines what Stat Test you roll for when making an attack with the Weapon.
- **Ability:** Each of the 16 Standard Weapons comes with a unique ability you can perform when in combat. These abilities are described on the Weapons Reference of the [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks) of the world you are playing on.

##### Ammulator

Ammulators are tiny devices that are equipped to most Weapons that require ammunition. These allow most Weapons to function without the burden of tracking ammunition. Ammulators are also applied to most throwable Weapons, as a device you would wear on your wrist, removing the need to recover said Weapons when thrown. You can learn more about Ammulators in detail in here.

##### Custom and Improvised Weapon Types

Each world has a list of Standard Weapon types with a predefined range, associated stat, and ability. More powerful weapons will have higher damage modifiers.

There are options beyond Standard Weapons. Any other weapons will either be classified a Custom Weapon or an Improvised Weapon:

**Custom Weapons:** A custom weapon is a Weapon not listed in the world’s standard weapon’s list. Custom weapons may or may not use a unique ability. A custom weapon is created at the discretion of your CC.

> _Examples: a gun disguised as a briefcase, a throwing star, a slinghot, a unique bow given to you by the king._

**Improvised Weapons:** An improvised Weapon is anything you are trying to deal damage with that is not already classified as a Weapon. Improvised weapons do not have an inherent ability. Improvised Weapons can be temporary (such as hitting somebody with a book), or permanent (such as strapping a book to the end of a stick and using it as your main Weapon). A temporary improvised Weapon returns to its normal status after a single use, whereas a permanent improvised Weapon remains a Weapon in your belongings from the point of creation.

> _Examples: a brick, a broom, shard of glass, a book, a book taped on a stick._

##### Creating Your Weapons

You can find a list of Weapons available to use on your world in your world’s [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks). This list consists of the 16 Standard Weapons. There can be other types of Weapons, but those are treated as custom or improvised Weapons that you or your CC create for yourselves. The Lore of the world you are playing on is a great place to go for inspiration on possible custom or improvised Weapons.

### Wearables

Wearables are belongings taht you wear on your body.

You can have 7 Wearables equipped at any given time, one in each of the following areas: Head, Face, Torso, Arms, Hands, Legs, and Feet. Any Wearables you are not wearing can be stored in your SURONIS.

Wearables are defined by a name, description, body area, modifier, speed adjustment, and shield value.

- **Name:** The name of the Wearable.
- **Description:** A physical description of the Wearable. It can be heavy, hot, stylish, ragged, etc.
- **Body Area:** Where on your person you can wear this Wearable. You cannot wear two Wearables on the same body area.
- **Modifier:** The action(s) that this wearable helps you to perform, and the modifier attached to the action(s). Example: Gloves with a +2 Hacking Modifier and +2 Waving Modifier.
- **Speed Adjustment:** The amount that this Wearable adjusts your movement speed.
- **Shield Value:** This adds to your overall Shield Value and reduces incoming damage by this number.

##### Creating Your Wearables

It is mainly up to you and your CC to create the Wearables you will be using. The Lore of the world you play on will provide information on Wearables, such as fashion and what stat modifiers are likely to be on them. There also may be a list of Wearables to inspire creativity, but, ultimately, it is up to you and your CC to create Wearables that fit your character.

### Consumables

Consumables are items that have a defined number of uses that are consumed as you utilize them. This could be a bag of beef jerky, a collection of matches, or a bottle of water.

You can have 3 separate Consumables on your person at any given time. Any Items that you wish to carry but cannot keep on your person can be stored in your SURONIS.

Consumables are defined by a name, description, categories, level, and uses.

- **Name:** This is the name of the Consumable.
- **Description:** The description of the Consumable.
- **Categories:** One or more categories that describes what the Consumable does. The different available categories and their definitions are explained in the [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks) of the world you are playing on.
- **Level:** Level from 1 – 10 that determines how powerful the category effect is..
- **Uses:** How many times you can use the Consumable before it is destroyed/useless. Consumable uses cannot be restored unless otherwise stated.

##### Creating Your Consumables

You can find a list of Consumable Categories in your world's [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks). These categories explain exactly what a Consumable does, and how well it does it. When creating a Consumable, you first choose one or more of these categories, but then it is up to your creativity to determine what the exact item is. The Lore of the world you are playing on is a great way to find inspiration when creating your Consumables. Most of the time, it is your CC who will create these Consumables for you to find or buy, but they may also allow you to create your own at times.

### Usables

You can have 3 separate Usables on your person at any given time. Any Usables that you wish to carry but cannot keep on your person can be stored in your SURONIS.

Usables are defined by a name, and description, type, and units.

- **Name:** This is the name of the Usable.
- **Description:** The description of the Usable.
- **Type:** This helps determine the value of the Usable, as well as likelihood that you will run into one. The options are common, semi-common, rare, collectable, and one-of-a-kind.
- **Units:** This refers to the unit of measurement for the Usable. This can be feet, pounds, bottles, scoops, handfuls, truckloads, etc.

##### Creating Your Usables

Usables describe anything from a flash drive to a piece of parchment to an microwave. Therefore, almost every Usable that you or your CC create is going to be custom. When creating a Usable, the most important thing to fill out is its type. This determines its value, based on the economy of your world. You will be able to find information on what Usables would be what types (as well as what Usables would even be available) in the Lore of the world you are playing on.
