### Version: Beta-0.0.5

### Campaign Captain (CC)

YOUR CC is the storyteller of your world. They will describe the world around you, play every NPC and enemy, determine difficulty, and enforce the rules of the game. The CC has the power to change rules to fit their own playstyle or the situation. Whatever the CC says is law within the game.

### Character Sheet

Your Character Sheet is made up of three pages:

The first contains your character description, character background, character log, and notes.

The second contains your stats, basic info, equipped belongings, and Augmentations. Augmentations allow you to perform feats that would not otherwise be possible (see [Augmentations](#augmentations)).

The third represents your SURONIS. Your SURONIS (aka Spatially Unaware Rucksack of Nearly Infinite Space) is where you can store all your belongings that you do not currently have equipped (see [Your SURONIS](#your-suronis)). Your SURONIS and belongings are explained in detail in [Belongings In-Depth](#belongings-in-depth-section).

### Creating Your Character

The first steps to create your character are as follows:

1. Choose your Species
2. Create your Character Description
3. Create your Character Background
4. Fill out your Stats
5. Fill out your Basic Info
6. Pick your starting equipped belongings

Your CC may give you guidance, bonuses, or restrictions on how to create your character. The rules of your CC trump any rules we have written.

### Species

Species describe the different sentient creature types in Aberrations RPG. They are typically defined by their appearance, and general demeanor. Each Species has different starting stats and their own unique Augmentation.

You can learn more about what Species you can choose in the [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks) of the world you are playing on.

### Character Background

Your Character Background is the meat and bones to roleplaying your character. Here you will describe what makes you tick. Why are you the way that you are? What are your ambitions? Do you have any secrets? What are your flaws? Write down everything that is important to who you are. If you need more space, you can write more in your Notes.

##### Character Log

Your character log is sort of like your journal. It is where you write down significant events that happen to you and change you throughout your sessions, because nobody stays the same forever. You typically write one character log at the end of each session.

### Character Description

Your Character Description is what you look like on the outside. Here you will describe your appearance, age, height, weight, and any other important details about your character. Do you have a long scar across your face? Do you have long, luscious flowing locks of hair? Well, here is where you say so. If you need more space, you can track additional details of your character in your Notes.

> _There may be times when an action that normally falls under one stat might fall under another. The CC has the power to change the Stat used at any time._

### Using Your Stats

##### Stat Test

When attempting to perform an action for the first time, your CC may decide to have you perform a Stat Test for an associated Stat. You will then roll a number of dice (d6s) equal to your Stat Score in that same Stat. You will then total how many of the dice results are equal to or above 4. These are called successes.

Prior to your roll, the CC not only would have determined the associated Stat but would have also set a Difficulty Rating of 1-15 for the action you are attempting. If the number of your successes is equal to or above the Difficulty Rating, then you may perform that action.

Stat Tests are ways to determine your character’s ability to perform that action. Therefore, after making the Stat Test, you cannot roll to perform that same action again unless the circumstances surrounding that action change. Your CC is the one who determines what a constitutes a change in circumstances. If you fail the Stat Test, you must somehow make the action easier, by changing circumstances, to re-attempt the action. If you succeed on the Stat Test, you can automatically continue to perform the same action unless there are circumstances that make the Stat Test more difficult or different enough to warrant a new Stat Test.

> _Many things will have a predetermined associated stat to roll for, such as Weapons, items, and Augmentations._

> _There may be times when you want to apply less successes than your result. You may choose to declare how many of your rolled successes you are applying to your action before that action is completed. This cannot be used to gain critical successes, or critical failures, if you did not otherwise roll them._

##### Contested Stat Test

When performing a test against another creature's ability, such as pickpocketing, persuasion, or an arm wrestle, you must make a Contested Stat Test. In a Contested Stat Test, both parties make a Stat Test for the associated Stat. The party with the higher number of successes wins the Contested Stat Test, with ties going to the assailant/character attempting the Stat Test. If the target is unaware, they gain –1 Advantage (see [Advantage](#advantage)).

##### Stat Score

Your Stat Score refers to how many points you have in a specific Stat. You have a maximum Stat Score of 10 for each Stat, however, your equipped belongings and/or Augmentations can additionally modify your Stat Score up to 5 points in either direction. This makes your true maximum Stat Score 15 points.

We refer to these two types of Stat Points as Natural Stats and Modified Stats. Your starting Natural Stat points are determined by your chosen Species. Your Modified Stat points, as stated, are determined by your equipped belongings and Augmentations.

##### Experience

When more than half of your Stat Test roll is made up of successes, you gain one Experience in the associated Stat you rolled for. You gain one Experience even if you did not roll well enough to perform your attempted action. Experience is represented by the bubbles underneath your Stat on the Character Sheet.

##### Upgrading Stats

When you get the chance to slumber (see [Resting](#resting)), look at your Experience. If your Experience is equal to or greater than your Stat Score in the associated Stat, then reset your Experience to 0 and increase the associated Stat Score by 1. When you level up a Stat, you also gain one Upgrade Point (see [Upgrade Points](#upgrade-points)).

> _When leveling up your Stats, your Stat Score is both your Natural and Modified Stat Scores together. If you need to take off your helmet to get that level up, then be our guest._

##### Temporary Modifiers

Temporary Modifiers can be given to you via the use of Augmentations, certain belongings, role-playing, or other events in the game. Temporary Modifiers can be negative or positive and have no maximum or minimum limits. When making a Stat Test, Temporary Modifiers adjust your Advantage value (see [Advantage](#advantage)). It is up to you and your CC to track when Temporary Modifiers should be removed.

### Your Character's Basic Info

Your characters Basic Info is a grouping of the information that is important to gameplay. Some of it is calculated based on your Stats. These calculations are called Passive Stats, because you do not roll for them. Be sure to round down in any calculations that you make.

Your Basic Info contains the following:

##### Name

The name of your player character.

##### Species

The information for the Species that you chose. This includes the starting ability of that Species.

##### Current HP

How many health points you have left. When taking damage, reduce your current health by that much damage. When this value reaches 0, you become Nearly Dead (see [Death](#death)).

##### Passive Stats

Your passive stats are stats that are calculated from your four main Stats: Fortitude (FOR), Agility (AGL), Persona (PER), and Aptitude (APT).

**Max Health (MAX HP):** MAX HP is how much health you can have at once. You cannot heal past this amount.

> _Your MAX HP is determined by your Fortitude (FOR) Stat x 5 (if FOR = 4 then MAX HP = 20)._

**Dodge Value (DV):** Your DV is how many hits you can dodge when you are being attacked (see [Combat](#combat)).

> _Your DV is determined by Agility (AGL) Stat / 3 (rounded down)._

**Initiative (IN):** Your IN determines your turn order when combat is initiated. The character with the highest initiative takes the first turn (see [Initiative](#initiative)).

> _Your IN is determined by Persona (PER) Stat._

**Support (SP):** Your SP determines how much Advantage you can add to an ally’s roll when you use the Assist action (see [Actions & Tests](#actions-and-tests)).

> _Your SP is determined by Aptitude (APT) Stat / 2 (rounded down)._

##### Power

Your Power is the total number of all your Stat Scores for each Stat, added together (both your Natural Stats and Modified Stats). Your Power is used by your CC to help make the game more balanced.

##### Movement Speed

Your character’s base movement speed is 3. Your movement speed determines how many spaces you can move in a single turn. If you wish to move further, you can attempt to run, if desired (see [Actions & Tests](#actions-and-tests)).

##### Upgrade Points

When you level up a Stat, you gain a single Upgrade Point. Upgrade Points can be used to purchase Augmentations (see [Augmentations](#augmentations)).

##### Mortality

You start with 0 Mortality. Each time you become Nearly Dead, raise your Mortality by 1. Your Mortality is how many successes you must roll at minimum in order to recover from being Nearly Dead (see [Death](#death)).

##### Wallet

Your Wallet holds the money you currently have on your person. You use this to purchase belongings and elevate your status in the world (at least in your own mind). The currency used is determined by the world you are playing in. If you have other money not on you, you can keep track of that on your Character Sheet.

### Conditions

Conditions allow you to track any adjustments you need to make in your Stats or actions due to the state of being or mind that your character is in. Each condition has a certain number of points associated with it. They all start at zero, but when you gain a condition, you add a point to the total. There is no limit to how many points you can have in a condition, but you will find that consequences can be severe if they are allowed to build to high values.

There are currently four different conditions you might gain: Slowed, Injured, Disturbed, and Agony. Each condition has its own way of removing points once you have gained them.

**Slowed:** For every point you have in Slowed, your movement and Dodge Value are reduced by one space. If you have more than 5 Slowed, you cannot move without running, and each point in Slowed above 5 is subtracted from your successes when you take the Run action. If you have the same or more Slowed than Dodge Value, your Dodge Value is 0. You can remove Slowed by eliminating whatever it is that is causing your condition, such as breaking free of your restraints, the drug wearing off, or using certain Consumables or Usables.

> _Reasons for gaining Slowed include, but are not limited to, when you are restrained, after certain attacks, use of certain Consumables or Usables._

**Injured:** When making a PHYSICAL Stat Test (Fortitude or Agility), your roll gets negative Advantage equal to the number of points you have in Injured. You can remove Injured through rest or taking certain Consumables.

> _Reasons for increasing your Injured total include rolling a critical failure in Fortitude or Agility, receiving low health conditions, and potentially other role-playing consequences as determined by your CC (like sticking your arm in a hole full of snakes, or licking a flagpole in sub-zero temperatures)._

**Disturbed:** When making a MENTAL Stat Test (Persona or Aptitude), your roll gets negative Advantage equal to the number of points you have in Disturbed. You can remove Disturbed through rest or taking certain Consumables.

> _Reasons for increasing your Disturbed total include rolling a critical failure in Persona or Aptitude, something traumatizing happening to your character, and potentially other role-playing consequences as determined by your CC (like being terrified of a creature, distracted by some bad news, etc.)._

**Agony:** At the beginning of each of your turns, you are dealt damage equal to your Agony. If play is not operating in turn order, your CC will set a time interval (such as every 5 minutes) that you will be dealt the damage in. You can remove Agony by removing or stopping whatever is giving you the Agony, such as putting out the fire on your back, taking an antidote while poisoned, or getting to the surface when drowning.

> _Reasons for increasing your Agony can vary. Your Agony may increase if you are on fire, poisoned, drowning, freezing, etc. It is possible to have multiple reasons at once that you are in Agony. You are in charge of tracking what is causing your Agony (and how much Agony it is causing) and finding ways to put a stop to it._

### Augmentations

Augmentations are abilities, both passive and active, that allow your character to perform feats that would not otherwise be possible.

You can purchase an Augmentation at any time using Upgrade Points, but it takes 6 in-game hours for that Augmentation to become available to you. You many purchase and download multiple Augmentations simultaneously.

You can find the full list of Augmentations available in the [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks) of the world you are playing on.

### Belongings

Belongings are split into four categories: Weapons, Wearables, Consumables, and Usables. Below is an overview of each type of belonging, and how many you are allowed to have equipped on your person at one time. The belongings that are available for your use is dependent on the world you are playing on, and that information is found in that world's [World Playbook](/get-started/world-playbooks).

**Weapons:** Any belonging whose main purpose is to inflict damage. You can have 2 Weapons equipped on your person at any given time.

> _Every Weapon will have an associated Stat, which is the type of Stat Test you make when attempting to use it._

**Wearables:** Any belonging that you can wear. You can have 7 Wearables equipped at any given time, one in each of the following areas: Head, Face, Torso, Arms, Hands, Legs, and Feet.

**Consumables:** Any belonging that has a limited number of uses, whether through use or eating. You can have 3 separate Consumables on your person at any given time.

> _Having 2 of the same Consumable is not the same as having a Consumable with 2 uses; therefore, in the former example, you would use 2 slots to carry the 2 copies of that Consumable on your person._

**Usables:** Any belonging that you can use, is not destroyed by use, and does not fall into any of the above categories. You can have 3 separate Usables on your person at any given time.

##### Your SURONIS

Your Spatially Unaware Rucksack of Nearly Infinite Space is where you can store all your additional belongings that you cannot keep equipped on your person. It can store an infinite number of belongings, however, when a belonging is in your SURONIS, it is still able to be pickpocketed.

##### Equipping and Unequipping

If you wish to trade out which belonging you have equipped, you may do so by putting the currently equipped belonging into your SURONIS and taking out the belonging you want to replace it with. Removing or putting a belonging in your SURONIS each require a minor action (see [Performing Actions](#performing-actions)).

##### Belongings In-Depth

A more detailed description of each belonging is listed at the end of this rulebook, under the [Belongings In-Depth](#belongings-in-depth-section) section. There you will learn about associated stats, abilities, types, and more, as well as how to fill out your belongings’ information.

### Performing Actions

There are three categories that any action can be classified down to: Major Actions, Minor Actions, and Free Actions. A list of common and unique actions you may use during gameplay is provided as a reference at the end of this rulebook (see [Actions & Tests](#actions-and-tests)).

**Major Actions:** Major Actions are actions that require a Stat Test. Some feats may require more than one major action to complete (this will be determined at the CCs discretion) and will require multiple turns to complete. Major Actions can be used to perform a Minor Action instead, if desired.

**Minor Actions:** Minor Actions are actions that don’t require a Stat Test to perform (moving, exerting, etc.). Multiple minor actions may be performed using a single minor action point if it is plausible that both these actions could be performed at the same time (such as picking up a soda can as you run down the hall, opening a door as you reload a magazine, or texting and driving).

**Free Actions:** Free Actions are actions that can be easily performed while doing something else (whistling, talking, etc.).

### Critical Successes and Failures

When performing an action, there is always a possibility of rolling either a critical success or a critical failure.

**Critical Success:** When more than half of the dice that you roll are 6s, you can act as if all of dice that you rolled were a success. When doing so, gain 2 experience points instead of 1.

**Critical Failure:** When more than half of the dice that you roll are 1s, you act as if all the dice rolled were failures and you automatically fail the test. You also gain one point in either the Injured (Fortitude/Agility) or Disturbed (Persona/Aptitude) condition, depending on which Stat you rolled for.

### Advantage

When performing rolls, you may come across a situation where external variables enhance or decrease your ability to perform an action. We call this Advantage. You gain or lose Advantage based on the variables in play. Gaining or losing Advantage is at the discretion of the CC.

**Positive Advantage:** When you have Net 1 Advantage, you roll 1 extra die. You may replace any of your other rolls with that extra die. Net 2 Advantage allows you to roll 2 extra dice, and so on.

**Negative Advantage:** When you have Net -1 Advantage, you roll an extra die. If the result on this die is lower than your highest roll, then you must replace your highest roll with this result. Net 2 Advantage forces you to do this with 2 dice and your 2 highest rolls, and so on.

**Neutral/No Advantage:** Most rolls are going to be made with Net 0 Advantage. These are handled normally.

### Non-Combat

When outside of combat, you do not perform in a turn order. You can simply tell your CC that you would like your character to perform any possible action, whether that be a major, minor, or free action. The CC can then allow you to perform that action, make you roll for an associated stat (a Stat Test) to see if you perform that action, or tell you that that action is impossible. It is only when you enter combat that you must track your actions each turn.

### Combat

There may come a time when you need to fight. When there comes a point where one or more individuals becomes aggressive, everyone in the vicinity enters combat and rolls for Initiative.

While in combat, you have 1 Major Action Points and 1 Minor Action Point to use each turn. You may choose to use both, one, or none of these actions. You also have unlimited free actions that can be performed at any time during your turn, or on another character’s turn.

##### Initiative

When combat is initiated, everyone checks their Initiative passive stat value. Combat is then initiated in order of highest to lowest in reference to each character’s Initiative. If there is a tie, player characters beat non-player characters. If there is a tie between players, then the tied players may choose which order to play in.

##### Attacking

You may use a Major Action on your turn to attack. Attacking uses a Weapon to deal damage to another creature. When attacking, declare a target and roll a Stat Test for the associated stat of the Weapon you are using. Tally up your successes from that roll and subtract the target’s Dodge Value. The remaining number is how many times you hit your target. Multiply that number by your Weapons damage, and that is how much damage your target takes.

> _You make an attack with a Strength Weapon that has a damage of 1 against a target with a Dodge Value of 2. You have 5 Strength. You roll 4 successes. Target dodges 2 attacks and is hit by 2 attacks. Since your Weapon has a damage of 1, you deal 2 damage to your target._

**Surprise Attacks:** When a target is surprised by the attack, they do not have enough time to react and dodge the attack. Therefore, when making a surprise or sneak attack, you do not subtract the target’s Dodge Value from your total Successes.

**Headshot:** At any time, when making an attack (including melee attacks), a character may attempt to make a headshot. When making a headshot, the defending character’s Dodge Value is doubled. If your rolled successes are more than the defending character’s adjusted Dodge Value, then the attack is treated as if you rolled all successes. The defending character’s unmodified Dodge Value is still considered when calculating damage dealt. If your rolled successes are equal to or less than your target’s Dodge Value, then no damage is dealt. Any kind of attack specified against a specific area of a target’s body uses this same principal, with varying amounts of damage delt, up to the discretion of the CC. If making a surprise attack, the character’s Dodge Value is treated as if the attacker was making a normal attack.

**Taking Aim:** Taking a minor action to simply aim your Weapon at a specific target gives you +1 Advantage on your next attack against that target as long as the they do not move out of your line of sight and you are not attacked or otherwise distracted before that attack. Using a major action gives you +2 Advantage to your next attack. If you use both your minor and major action to take aim, you may gain +1 die to your next attack roll instead of gaining Advantage.

**Line of Attack:** If you are attempting an attack on an opponent, and a character is in your direct line of attack, then you must roll at least one success in order to hit your intended target. If you do not roll a success, then you hit the character that is in your direct line of attack instead. The rules of Cover (see [Advantage in Combat](#advantage-in-combat)) apply in this situation, and you most likely will be given negative Advantage on this attack.

**Attacks Against Inanimate Objects:** Similarly, inanimate objects do not typically have a Dodge Value and therefore you do not subtract their Dodge Value from your attack. The exception being if you are attacking a vehicle that is being controlled by another character and is therefore maneuverable.

**Delaying:** Delaying allows you to perform the remainder of your turn after another character in the combat order, or after a specific variable occurs. Delaying cannot be used to interrupt another character’s turn unless you specifically define your intended action(s) when declaring your intention to check (i.e., aiming for a door and saying you will shoot anything that comes through the door). If for whatever reason, the chosen character cannot perform their turn, or if the variable does not occur, then you lose the remainder of your turn. The act of delaying is considered a free action, but whatever action points you use while delaying are expended normally.

##### Advantage in Combat

There are specific scenarios that will give a character Advantage while attacking in combat. It is important to remember that Advantage in combat only affects accuracy rolls. It is even more important to remember that these combat advantages also apply to NPCS.

- **Flanking:** +1 Advantage for every friendly character who is also in combat and is adjacent to the enemy that you are attacking (this includes ranged attacks).
- **High Ground:** +1 Advantage if you are at least 5 feet above your target.
- **Prone:** +1 advantage if your target is laying on the ground.
- **Pinned:** +1 Advantage if your target is pinned.
- **Multitasking:** -1 Advantage if a character is using 1 Action Point to perform 2 actions.
- **Cover:** -3 Advantage if target isn’t visible behind cover. -2 Advantage if target is behind cover and less than 25% of them is visible. -1 Advantage if they are 50%-75% visible behind cover.

### Low Health Conditions

As you start to lose health, your character will become weary and won’t perform at their best. There are two notable states you can be in when it comes to low health conditions. We refer to these states as Bloodied and Mauled.

**Bloodied:** While you are below half health (rounded down), you become bloodied. When you become bloodied, gain 1 point in Injured. You retain that point of Injured, even if you heal above ½ health, however, if you fall back below ½ health after that, during the same combat, you do not gain another point in Injured, no matter how many times that may happen.

**Mauled:** Whenever you are below a 1/5 health, meaning, your Current HP is less than your Fortitude stat, you become mauled. Whenever you take damage while mauled, you gain 1 additional point in Injured. When you heal above 1/5 health, you no longer gain additional points in Injured when taking damage.

### Resting

Eventually, everyone needs a rest. Resting allows you to recover some Health, remove all Injured and Disturbed conditions, and level up your stats (if you have enough experience points).

The party may have a rotating watch during a rest, but you may not perform any other actions during a rest if you wish to gain the benefits of it.

Rests are broken down into two categories: Slumbers and Naps.

**Slumber:** A slumber is an uninterrupted rest that lasts for 8 hours or more. During a slumber, you recover Health points equal to your Fortitude stat, you may level up your stats if possible, and all your points in Injured and Disturbed are removed.

**Naps:** Naps are rests that last less than 8 hours, but more than 1 hour. Naps will allow you to recover Health points equal to half your Fortitude stat (rounded down), as well as remove 1 point of Injured, OR 1 point of Disturbed. You cannot level up your Stats during a nap.

**Lack of Rest:** If your character goes 24 hours in-game time without resting, you gain 1 point in the Disturbed condition. You gain another point in the Disturbed condition every 12 hours after that, until your character finally rests.

### Death

When you reach 0 health points or below, your character becomes Nearly Dead. While your character is Nearly Dead, you are unconscious, and therefore cannot perform any actions or interact with other in any way. You also cannot receive any more damage from attacks that are targeted at you.

When your character becomes Nearly Dead, you must immediately add one point to your Mortality. You are out of commission until the end of combat (unless an Augmentation allows otherwise). When combat has officially ended (as declared by your CC), any surviving non-player or player characters can choose to revive you, whether friend or foe. Characters that also became Nearly Dead this combat cannot help revive any of the other characters. If your character is not revived at the end of combat, you become Totally Dead.

> _While we refer to combat specifically, there are other situations that may cause Near Death but may not necessarily qualify as combat (such as falling off a building). In these instances, you can be revived right away, as long as other characters can get to you within a reasonable amount of time._

**Revival Roll:** When an attempt to revive you is made, roll a number of dice equal to your unmodified Fortitude Stat. This roll determines whether you can recover from your major injuries, or you become Totally Dead. If you roll a number of successes equal to or more than your Mortality, you are able to recover. Upon recovery, you regain consciousness and have an amount of health equal to the number of successes you rolled.

> _Each character that is attempting to revive you may choose to add +1 Advantage to your roll. This means that if you have three characters attempting to revive you, you get up to +3 Advantage. If you have 10 characters attempting to revive you, you get up to +10 Advantage, and so on._

**Inspire:** While Nearly Dead, you may choose to inspire a character of your choosing. When you inspire a character, they gain Advantage equal to your Mortality on their next roll. You may only inspire a character one time per Near Death experience.

> _Two Nearly Dead characters can inspire the same character, and can even inspire them at the same time, resulting in Advantage given equal to both Mortalities combined on the inspired characters next roll._

**Revival Roll:** Each character that is attempting to revive you may choose to add +1 Advantage to your roll. This means that if you have three characters attempting to revive you, you get up to +3 Advantage. If you have 10 characters attempting to revive you, you get up to +10 Advantage, and so on.

**Totally Dead:** If you do not roll enough successes on your Fortitude Stat Test, then you are Totally Dead. At this point, your character is out of the game and your inventory can be looted by other characters. A new character can now be created if you wish to continue playing in the campaign.

> _The more you become Nearly Dead, the harder it gets to recover, and your chances of becoming Totally Dead increase._

**Instant Death:** If the final blow that causes death inflicts so much damage that your resulting Current HP is less than or equal to the negative value of your Max HP, then you are immediately deemed Totally Dead, and have no chance to recover.

> _There are certain abilities and items that can bring characters back from Total Death, but they are rare, full of stipulations, and often come at a heavy price._
