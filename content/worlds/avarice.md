      content: "### About Vehicles\r

        \r

        On Avarice, vehicles become extensions of the driver’s self;
        amplifying their physical prowess and abilities. The driver cannot make
        any actions outside of driving, piloting, or otherwise controlling the
        vehicle. Passengers can control themselves and move around the vehicle
        as they wish. But the pilot has control over any doors, automatic
        windows, and other automatic processes. Vehicle stats are considered to
        be passive. Any tests made by the driver are made with their own
        personal stats. \r

        \r

        In combat, if you attack with the vehicle, the vehicle is
        treated as a weapon using a different stat depending on the type of
        attack. A simple ram (straight shot at full speed) uses Aptitude, a side
        bash (turning into the attack) will use Agility, a trick shot (something
        with jumps, flips, or otherwise abusing your vehicle) will use persona,
        and a force of vehicular strength (Pulling, or trying to tear something
        apart) will use Strength. Vehicles have extreme destructive potential.
        However, when attacking with a vehicle, the vehicle takes half damage
        (rounded down). \r

        \r

        Much like other items, the stats on a vehicle are determined by
        levels. You will multiply your own stat by the vehicle’s stat level to
        determine your vehicle’s passive stat.  \r

        \r

        ### Vehicle Stats\r

        \r

        #### Speed\r

        \r

        Multiplying your aptitude by the vehicle’s speed level gives you
        your vehicle’s Passive Speed Stat. Each turn, you may move as far as you
        did last turn, plus a number of spaces equal to your vehicle’s speed
        stat. (For example, if you moved 7 spaces last turn and had a speed stat
        of 3, your vehicle can move a maximum of 10 spaces this turn). Avarice
        vehicles do not have a maximum speed cap, but high speeds make
        collisions, loss of control, or other crashes to be more likely. \r

        \r

        #### Health \r

        \r

        Multiplying the pilot’s current health by the vehicle’s Health
        level gives the vehicle’s overall health. When leaving the vehicle, in
        turn, divide the vehicle’s overall health by the vehicle’s health level
        to get the health of the pilot. Destroying the vehicle kills the
        pilot.  \r

        \r

        ### Terrain Types\r

        \r

        There are five specified terrain types:\r

        ### About


        Congo prides themselves on being ‘for the people’ when in reality, it is for itself. Every citizen of Congo is given free housing and transportation (which they use for work). The quality of housing they receive is dependent upon which job they work at. They also receive a grocery stipend, which they can use exclusively on CongoFresh, to order groceries for their family. All of these ‘perks’ may seem nice until you realize they are deducted from a citizens salary, leaving them with not much else to spend. In addition, they must use what little salary they net to pay their citizenship fees. 


        In the end, the perks are only there to keep Congonians stuck serving the corporate machine of the Congo, because it means that if they tried to leave the Congo, they would have nothing but the small amount of money they managed to scrounge up. 


        Just think of every Congo city as one large, suburban, white-picket fence, judgmental, ritzy neighborhood with a power-hungry ruling overlord of an HOA, where everybody works for the same factory, but in different positions, and it is those positions that determine class. 


        ### Who's in Charge?


        The CEO of Congo is Jamarcus Leverage. Jamarcus is the 5th CEO of Congo, with the four priors being his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great grandfather, and Leanord Randerson (the original founder of Congo, who is in fact not part of the Leverage family tree). 


        Jamarcus Leverage takes a minimum salary that is 16 times the salary of his highest paid executives. He leaves the running of the company mainly to his board of directors, who he pays handsomely to adhere to his whims. 


        ### Capital City


        The Capital City of the Congo is simply called ‘Congo City.’ This is where CEO Jamarcus Leverage and his board of directors reside. Congo City is a perfectly manicured suburban (intentionally not urban) utopia, which only the Congonians who have truly dedicated their lives to the Congo get to live. 


        ### Products and Services


        Congo sells just about everything you can imagine, and they deliver it straight to your door. They have developed various technological devices that allow you to order what you need from anywhere – smart fridges, apps, and even vehicular audio tones.  


        Congo has split their services into sections. The sections are: 


        * CongoGen – general retail of most all non-perishable goods 

        * CongoFresh – retail and delivery of groceries and perishable goods 

        * CongoCall – house visits from field experts, ranging from geologists to doctors to peacekeepers to dancers 

        * CongoEdu – subscription box service that provides children with education they need to succeed 

        * CongoCall and CongoEdu are only available to Congo Citizens and are not world-wide services. CongoFresh and CongoGen are both available world-wide, for a fee, of course. 


        ### Types of Jobs


        Each adult citizen of the Congo must hold a job in order to be a citizen (unless they are of age and have followed the structured retirement plan Congo sets for them). Which job a citizen holds has come to determine their class. 


        * Packers – These are the warehouse workers, and includes every job from packing boxes to warehouse management 

        * Deliverers – These are the people who are out there delivering packages all over the world. The most coveted routes are the ones local to a Congo city, but only the longest-working citizens get these routes 

        * Educators – These are the people who put together the CongoEdu box subscriptions and send them out each week (the learning material is decided by the board of directors and other executives) 

        * Chefs – These are the people who accept Ambrosia food shipments and repackage them into CongoFresh boxes, based on what was ordered 

        * Experts – These are the doctors, scientists, housekeepers, butlers, pest control technicians, and all of the other CongoCall field experts a Congonian can order. 

        * Executives – These are the people who have gotten away from manual labor and now work in the high-rise buildings. They take care of big picture stuff that they deem important 

        * Board of Directors – The highest point a Congonian can reach in their career. Once they are here, they have made it. 


        Every new Congonian (whether they just became citizens or turned 18) is hired as a Packer or a Deliverer. If they want to work their way up from those positions, they have two paths: CongoU (an online degree that Congo offers free to all their citizens), or working up the ladder (and hope for the chance to eventually become an executive).  


        If a Congonian chooses to pursue a CongoU degree, then they have the choice to study to become an Educator, Chef, Expert, or Executive. Upon graduation, they can begin applying for jobs in the field they have studied.  


        ### What is Life Like?


        People choose to become citizens of the Congo because they want predictability and security in their life. They live in maintained homes, have clear goals for the future, and have a great work-life balance, working 54 consistent hours per week (8 hours per day, 7 days a week) with absolutely no overtime. There are three 8 hour shifts each day, 8am – 4pm, 4pm – 12am, and 12am – 8am. Unless a Congonian changes jobs, their shift will always be the same. This allows them to be free to experience life as they wish, and gives them a consistency that they crave. 


        Each Congo city is made up of a city center, where the executives work, with many surrounding suburbs and neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are developed by Congo, and are intentionally created to be inclusive. This means that they build different types of houses for each type of occupation. This makes the neighborhoods a mix of all the employment (or class) types, and leads to a lot of Deliverers and Packers being left out of the neighborhood barbecues. 


        Most every citizen of Congo speaks highly of the Congo and is glad to live there, because of the perks it offers. In reality, they are all trapped but refuse to acknowledge the fact and choose to ignore it and pretend everything is 100% okay. 


        Children in Congo are taught via CongoEdu and prepared to work as Packers and Deliverers when they are of adult age. Once they are of age, they are given the choice between the two jobs and must start paying citizenship fees, but they are also given their own houses and transportation, along with the rest of the perks of Citizenship. 


        ### Citizenship Requirements and Fees


        In order to be considered a Congo citizen, you must be of adult age, pay the Citizenship fees, work a Congo job, and live in a Congo city. There are absolutely zero exceptions to these rules. There are three tiers of Citizenship: Gold, Platinum, and Executive. 


        * Gold – free shipping and access to CongoEdu and CongoCall. This cost 20% of any income (adjusted annually), and is charged on an individual basis, regardless of marital status. 

        * Platinum – Gold, plus guaranteed same day shipping. This cost 40% of any income. 

        * Executive – Only offered to Executives or higher, it is subsidized by Congo and therefore only 5% of income, and offers all the same perks as Platinum. 


        Citizens must choose between Gold and Platinum citizenship. This choice weighs heavily on them, as it impacts more than just shipping, but what their neighbors think of them and their social class as well. 


        ### Laws and Regulations


        Law in Congo is governed heavily by social status and social rules. There are not necessarily any written laws, but citizens can report each other's accounts for various reasons, and a reported account is a big deal. This generally keeps citizens in line, but naturally there are still ‘crimes’ being committed (especially in secret).  


        If a citizen does not manage to keep it secret and are caught or suspected of anything that does not adhere to the social rules, then they would be reported. If they are reported too many times, their citizenship is redacted and they are forced to repay any salary (including the ‘perks’) that Congo has paid them in their lifetime. 


        The radicality of the punishments, regardless of crimes, and the subjectivity of who will report you and why you would be reported is a major factor in why the Congo neighborhoods are socially classed in the way they are. In one area a citizen might get reported for not wearing nice enough clothes, but in another they could walk naked and have nothing reported. 


        If a person is not a citizen and is committing ‘crimes’, then Congo citizens seeing this crime have a hotline they can call. In a matter of minutes, a group of peacekeeping forces (courtesy of the CongoCall ‘For the People’ initiative) will arrive to remove the trespassing individual from Congo property, by deadly force if necessary. The trespassing individual is scanned and placed on a blacklist, and can never become a Congo citizen for as long as they are on the blacklist (which is usually forever, but there are ways to get blacklisted names removed).

        ### About


        Ubiwerks is all about entertainment. They have theme parks, opera houses, movie theatres, and more all over their cities. They encourage all with acting and directing talent to join them and help them create wonderful entertainment. The people who live in Ubiwerks are very diverse and artistic, and there is always a lot going on, from farmers markets to art auctions, to the annual Ubiwerks brawl-fest. 


        ### Who's in Charge?


        Ubiwerks CEO is Ms. Sinarah Wisby. She was initially a popular movie star before she became the CEO (through her popularity). She doesn’t in actuality run the company, but she is the face of the company, gives, the pre-prepared speeches, and attends the meetings with an earpiece and just spouts what the board wants her to say. 


        ### Capital City


        Ubiwerks capital city is Firfornis, a glorious and beautiful city where only the elite of their society live. This is also where they host the annual Ubiwerks brawl-fest. The capital city is surrounded completely by more smaller cities, and those cities are rundown, scary places to be with narcotics running rampant. Because of this, there is a wall surrounding Firfornis and only those who can pay the substantial entrance fee (or can buy the yearly pass) are allowed in. 


        ### Products and Services


        Ubiwerks produces entertainment. People are constantly traveling into their cities from the surrounding areas to see the fantastical entertainment being produced by Ubiwerks cities. They have plays, musicals, movies, tv series, virtual realities, amusement parks, and even traveling entertainment that roams from city to city. 


        ### Types of Jobs


        Among the usual jobs that are required for a corponation to run, there are a lot of Ubiwerks citizens employed in the fine arts scene. This means that there are a lot of very popular and well-known figures in Ubiwerks, and a lot of people wanting to meet them and learn about them, which also produces a ton of journalism, reporting, and photography jobs for citizens to take. 


        ### What is Life Like?


        There are basically three distinct types of lives an Ubiwerks citizen could lead: one of luxury, one of poverty, or one of crime. Usually, both of the former two are still full of crime, just different kinds of crime. There are very distinct lines in cities (literally walls in most of them) that require a substantial fee, or pass in order to cross. These are all modeled after the capital city Firfornis. This leads to more white-collar and popular neighborhoods in the center, and poorer and dangerous neighborhoods on the outside of cities. 


        Visitors coming into the cities to see entertainment are usually transported via blocked off tunnels, or through the air, so they do not have to pass through the bad parts of the cities. It is a very real problem that the Ubiwerks board is just choosing to ignore. Some say that they are even causing the problem, but pumping the streets of the exteriors of cities with stimulants and drugs to make the city centers richer. 


        ### Citizenship Requirements and Fees


        One must only live within an Ubiwerks city to be an Ubiwerks citizen. They advertise that they do not charge any form of citizenship fee on income, but they do charge the entrance fees to the best (and real) parts of their cities. Citizenship doesn’t give you much if you are on the outside of those entrance walls. Peacekeeping forces and hospitals are scarce, as they spend most of their time inside the walls. Overall, there are free citizens, and paid citizens in Ubiwerks. The free citizens are offered basically nothing, while the paid citizens are offered everything. 


        ### Laws and Regulations


        The laws and regulations of Ubiwerks cities are pretty lax, to say the least. People can certainly get away with a lot, especially if they are popular. There are a lot of illegal activities going on in these cities. There is an Ubiwerks peacekeeping institution, but most of them are corrupt and take bribes to ignore the things that are happening. If you are going to break the law, probably do it here. At least that is what all of the criminal organizations moving to Ubiwerks are saying.

They did this because Ambrosia lets in only the best of the best. There is only one way in and out of the city, and that is through their heavily guarded and managed Transistor Portal. 


        Ambrosia, being a collection of the best minds of Avarice, has developed technology the other CorpoNations can only dream of. The foremost being the Formulator, which literally creates anything their citizens could want out of the air. All citizens are given one in their citizenship initiation ceremony. 


        ### Who's in Charge?


        Ambrosia is run by Evara Layne. She is the person who had the original idea to separate from A.F.C. and form their own CorpoNation. She was a technician in a technology production facility and stumbled upon the greatest discovery of her lifetime. Instead of sharing, she took her knowledge and the majority of A.F.C. into the clouds. 


        ### Capital City


        Ambrosia’s capital city, called Ambrosia, is also their only city. Don’t let that make you think there are not a lot of citizens, though. The floating city is enormous. It is propelled by engines that scorch the earth below, leaving a crater thousands of miles wide, and even more thousands of miles of toxic land, diseased, dying, and barren. In the city itself, everything is pristine and perfect.  


        ### Products and Services


        Ambrosia produces food and technology (in reality, it is technology that produces food). They only sell technology with limited functionality, in order to keep the world dependent on them. This really does cause the world to be dependent upon them for food and other technological necessities, which only swells the massive ego of the Ambrosia citizens. 


        ### Types of Jobs


        Ambrosia residents are given a formulator and housing that provides all of their needs. They also do not have to work, or do any labor of any kind. Most citizens do still volunteer in research facilities and production facilities, creating and inventing technology that helps them continue to live the life they have. 


        ### What is Life Like?


        There is a constant message being engrained into the citizens that they live in a perfect utopia. It is really not far from the truth, for them at least. For the outsider, citizens of Ambrosia are inconceivably naïve about the real world. The citizens are also ruled by a strict, iron fist that does not allow any deviance from what is considered perfection, causing some to live in fear. But most are too pampered by the lack of need and the sense of security that living in such a place gives them to realize this fear. 


        Visitors are allowed in specific sections of the city, to pick up goods and also as vacationers or tourists. When people enter the Transistor Portal, they are formed with a limited amount of time to spend in Ambrosia. When that time is up, they will dissolve and exit the Transistor Portal. Nobody knows how it really works, and there are many groups of people unwilling to use it in fear of a larger scheme going on. 


        ### Citizenship Requirements and Fees


        People cannot choose to be an Ambrosia citizen. Ambrosia carefully selects candidates who they want, and they send them invitations. If the invitation is accepted, a year-long application and testing process begins. Applicants are tested medically, mentally, emotionally. They are tested on their knowledge and their skills, and only if determined viable are they allowed to become a citizen. There is a ceremony of citizenship that occurs in which they (and their family, if the family also passed the tests) walk through the Transistor Portal, never to return to the mainland. 


        ### Laws and Regulations


        Ambrosia has strict behavior, health and intelligence regulations that must be adhered to. If these regulations are broken, then it results in immediate disappearance. At least, that is what the citizens call it. When a citizen misbehaves or is no longer up to par in health and intelligence, they are taken away and never seen again. The exact regulations that need to be adhered to are unknown, as they have never been definitively stated by Ambrosia. 


        When a visitor breaks one of these rules and is caught doing so, they are sent back through the Transistor Portal with a brand on their left forearm, for the world to see what they have done. If they are ever found again inside Ambrosia, they will experience disappearance and will never be seen again.

        to the best of our abilities.*


        ### About


        Flux, Inc cities are very quiet, peaceful places. They are almost always a mixture of above ground and below ground. The people are very kind and quick to help anybody in need. They are known for their fabulous tourist destination and inns. The citizens of Flux are most commonly Siede (hence the underground), but they are open and welcoming to all, and encourage every species to join them as citizens. 


        ### Who's in Charge?


        Mr. Charlie is the name of the President of Flux. He was elected for this term by the popular vote, and the people love him. He has done more for the CorpoNation than the past three Presidents combined. There are, however, groups who take issue and think that he is too open and inviting, worried that with more people comes less peace. 


        ### Capital City


        Flux doesn’t have a specific capital city. Their cities are built around their world-wide tunnel system, leaving them to be quite strung out. Instead, when a new President is elected, they make that Presidents hometown the temporary capital city, where speeches are given and meetings are held. That makes the current capital city President Mr. Charlie’s hometown of Groundsville (yes, very creative). 


        ### Products and Services


        Flux provides the world with access to their tunnel systems and transportations systems, both public and private. They have vehicular transportation that can cross the world in a matter of minutes, and are always expanding their tunnels to include more of the world. They are also partnering with a silent partner to create flying transportation vehicles, and are currently the largest provider of said vehicles, particularly to the Congo, who uses the flying vehicles and tunnels for their deliveries. 


        ### Types of Jobs


        Flux citizens can be found in jobs digging and mining tunnels, creating and designing vehicles, maintaining vehicles, and in executive positions within Flux. Flux also has many schools, hospitals, and food-places for their citizens, so Flux citizens can be found working and volunteering in those places as well. 


        ### What is Life Like?


        Life in Flux is quite relaxing. Some might say it is boring, but most who live there would just say peaceful and relaxing. They work, play, enjoy time with friends and family, and just generally live their life the way they want to. There can be danger, however, with the tunnel systems constantly being expanded they tend to run into a lot more violent creatures, and sometimes those creatures even run into them, occasionally terrorizing an entire underground city or tunnel until help is called or the city is abandoned. 


        ### Citizenship Requirements and Fees


        The only citizenship requirements in place for Flux, Inc is that an individual live in a Flux city and pay a flat 30% income tax, to pay for those in need. Flux provides assistance to everybody that they can. Citizens of Flux do not have to work for Flux itself, they just have to live in the city. This helps serve their greater goal to attract more citizens. 


        ### Laws and Regulations


        Flux has many laws that are in place to protect their citizens. If somebody breaks a law, they have to stand before a fair jury of their peers and have a trial. At the trial they are sentenced to a punishment, which can range from community service to imprisonment (if the crime was particularly terrible). Their prisons are places of education and amelioration, with the goal of helping the prisoner become a new person. 


        There is much peace around Flux, but there also can be violent problems that occur (just like they could anywhere), there are peacekeeper academies and other such training facilities sponsored by Flux, that help keep the citizens in line and safe.

        yourself.* 


        ### About


        Imperial Kuman Corporation is a modern corporation entrenched in its simplistically regulated past. The Imperial Kuman Corp has been around for a long time, and was mainly made up of Kuma citizens the entire time. Now, there are other species a part of it, but it still is a vast majority Kuma.  


        Citizens of Imperial Kuman Corp enjoy many liberties and freedoms, but only if those citizens are also Kuma. Otherwise, many of those liberties, freedoms (and even laws), do not apply to a citizen. This leads to a lot of ‘rough and tumble’ groups of non-Kuma species living as citizens of the Imperial Kuman Corp 


        ### Who's in Charge?


        The ruler, president, or CEO (whatever you want to call them) of Imperial Kuman Corp changes very often. This is because they determine the leader via competitive feats of strength. In the past, this was a fight to the death, but now, it is more Olympic-style. Who can climb to the top of the skyscraper faster, or who can hold the boulder above their head the longest, stuff like that. Any Kuma citizen (note, specifically Kuma citizen) can challenge the leader at any time.  


        This leads to many short-lived leaders making changed, and reverting previous changes, resulting in only the most widely known and ancient, traditional laws being the ones held in place. It also led to the council of elders being formed, a collection of the past surviving leaders who get together to make decisions. 


        ### Capital City


        The IKC capital city, Samar, is a place of astounding architecture, built back in the beginnings of time and maintained through now. The council of elders meets here. It is the largest city in the IKC, with the others being on a smaller scale, and more like villages. 


        ### Products and Services


        IKC provides general labor and services, both skilled and unskilled. They hire laborers and workers out for contracted periods of time. The laborers can be doing anything from designing and building a house or a capital building, to electric circuitry or shipbuilding, to architecture and engineering. They have trades and apprenticeship programs all through their cities that they go to learn trades and skills that have been passed down. They have an exclusive contract with Congo to build their housing, and they also worked on the floating city of Ambrosia before it was launched. 


        ### Types of Jobs


        Citizens of IKC can work in many different jobs or trades. They train engineers, electricians, constructors, the list goes on. The IKC is made up of thousands of smaller sub-corporations that are privately owned private practices, even some that are one individual. These smaller sub-corporations are registered to the IKC.  Any contracts go through the larger IKC corporation, and the IKC selects the individual contractors or companies they will assign to the project. 


        The IKC also provides universal healthcare, education and food by subsidizing the cost for businesses to start up in those categories. Many Kuma have started businesses in these subsidized categories, but many more non-Kuman citizens operated these types of businesses. 


        ### What is Life Like?


        Life is different in the IKC if you are Kuma versus if you are a different species. Any species can become a citizen and is afforded the rights that citizenship affords, but many old Kuma laws only apply to Kuma, and not the other species. This of course needs to be changed, but the structure of the government has caused this issue to be pushed to the side. 


        This results in many non-Kuman groups gathering in Kuma cities for their operations. It also results in many fights breaking out, because IKC law allows any citizen the right to put an end to illegality – by any means necessary. This makes many Kuma citizens be suspicious of non-Kuma citizens, which results in a fragile peace, easily broken by offenses. 


        Children are raised by their parents and taught in whatever school the parents choose. The schools will typically train and prepare children for apprentices or trades. Once the children are of age, they can get jobs and gain experience, and eventually create their own businesses if they desire. 


        ### Citizenship Requirements and Fees


        To be considered a Citizen of IKC you must work for them, or a sub-corporation run by them, or have a providing family member that works for them, or live in one of their cities. That is all it takes. There are not any fees to be a citizen. Qualifying as a citizen affords people certain rights that cannot be taken away (such as right to personship), but it also holds them accountable to the law, which can be antiquated at times. 


        ### Laws and Regulations


        The laws of IKC are all written in large lettering, in plain view, in their capital city. Originally, they were written on stone, but now they have a digitalized signboard. 


        There are many random laws, but there are only several that are regularly enforced. 


        * No Kuma, or citizens of IKC, are to be intentionally harmed, unless by requirement of law 

        * Crime is illegal and requires punishment. Crime is any intentional bodily harming, taking or destruction of property, slander or defamation of a citizen 

        * Crime is punishable by an equally criminal offence, to be rectified by those offended or a representative 


        Laws are enforced (and interpreted) by the citizens themselves, and not necessarily any peacekeeping forces. This gives all citizens the right to enact the law and justice upon any who break the law. This is mostly used only by Kuma citizens, but there have been non-Kuma citizens known to have enough guts to stand up for themselves.

      content: "The most prominent religion on Avarice is the ideology of the Point
        Watchers. There are different groups and sects of Point Watcher, but the
        core ideology behind it stays the same. \r

        \r

        Point Watcher believe that every action is assigned a point
        value, positive or negative, depending on whether it is good or bad, and
        how good or bad the action was. Since it would be nearly impossible to
        track every action a person takes, Point Watchers undergo a microchip
        installation process. This microchip monitors everything that you do,
        assigns those actions points, and then displays those points on your
        wrist (or forehead, and always have mirrors to check). An individual is
        not a true member until they have paid for and had this surgery. \r

        \r

        There are many differing groups that use the Point Watchers
        ideology. The two most popular are the Church of the Exact Center, and
        the Church of the Good People. The Church of the Good People believes
        that one should have as many positive points as possible, and are always
        looking for any way possible to increase their points (like holding a
        door open all day).  \r

        \r

        The Church of the Exact Center (know by outsiders as the Church
        of the Extreme Center) believe that you must always have 0 points on
        your arm. They will not let their members attend worship unless they
        have 0 points. These members are very extreme, and will do any bad that
        they must to remove any positive points, and any good that they must to
        remove negative points. It is not uncommon to see members outside the
        building on worship day insulting (or complementing) their fellow
        members, so that they can get their points to be zero. "

      content: This religion is an official religion of Avarice, but it was started by
        a group of Congo Executives who wanted a legal reason to request a day
        off each week. They formed a religion called the Executive Branch, and
        they worship each week by taking the day off work and playing golf with
        their friends. Surprisingly, this caught on and was implemented in the
        other CorpoNations, although it has since turned more into a ‘day of
        rest’ where they do whatever they would like, rather than a ‘day of
        golf’.
    - name: The Religion of the Kuma
      content: "The Religion of the Kuma is a very well-known religion. This is a
        belief system that nearly every Kuma has and has had, since the very
        beginning. The tenants of the religion are complex and not fully
        understood, however at the forefront is their belief that any creature
        that has been defeated by them (or surrenders) in combat, is a creature
        not worthy of the rights of personship. \r

        \r

        The Religion of the Kuma played an intense role in the Great
        Kuma War, and really only started because the Kuma held this belief.
        When the war was ended and relative peace was put into place, the Kuma
        had to majorly adjust. This is why the Imperial Kuman Corp still highly
        favors Kuma. While they now are willing to give the other sentient
        species the rights of personship, they still do no fully respect them at
        the same level that they respect each other."

        His life’s work is a fleet of miniature cities that travel
        around on massive wheels. The cities possess various technological
        capabilities, such as invisibility shields and weaponry. These cities
        travel all around the badlands below, and into nearby cities outside the
        badlands, capturing entire populations at a time sometimes and keeping
        them hostage in their traveling city. \r

        abilities. \r
