  description: This World Playbook is for the world of Avarice, a cyberpunk-ishly
    capitalistically dystopian tech world.
overview: "This World Playbook is for the world of Avarice. The Avarice World
  Playbook contains: Species, Augmentation Groups, Weapons, Consumable
  Categories, Creature Types, Optional World-Specific Rules you can choose to
  play by, and a World Summary of the world of Avarice. This playbook is
  condensed to only contain what is necessary to play on Avarice, so you don't
  have to go searching through the lore for what you need. If you are
  interested, you can [find the Lore of Avarice here](/worlds/avarice)."
species: The following are the currently known sentient and playable species on Avarice.
augmentations: >-
  Below are the five augmentation groups, with their Augmentations and the
  associated cost. When you are downloading an augmentation, you must spend the
  listed number of Experience to purchase it. You may download augmentations
  from any group and level during a Milestone event. 


  *Remember: it takes 6 in-game hours for an augmentation to fully activate.*
weapons: >-
  The following are the types of weapons currently available on Avarice.


  Weapon ranges are labeled as follows: Close (0 – 1 spaces), Short (2 – 4 spaces), Long (4 – 6 spaces), and Far (6 – 10 spaces). Attacking a target outside of your weapons range gives you –1 Advantage for each space outside the range that you are.
consumables: The following are the categories of consumables that are currently
  available on Avarice.
creatures: "This section is for CC’s (and curious players) to help guide the
  creature creation process, and learn what kind of creatures you might be up
  against as you explore the world. Below is the list of creature types there
  are discovered on Avarice. \r

  \r

  Any given creature can have multiple creature types that build off each
  other (such as a Monkey with the types: Pack and Aggressor). "
worldRules: "### SURONIS in World Lore \r

  \r

  In the lore of Avarice, the SURONIS is technology that was developed by the
  CorpoNation of Ambrosia. This means that the SURONIS has extra capabilities
  that CC’s can choose to add to their campaigns, if desired. The following list
  outlines abilities that your CC might add to your already existing SURONIS. \r

  \r

  **Communication Device:** Due to the advance nature of Avarice, your CC may
  decide to allow your SURONIS to be used as a communication device – this
  includes text, talk, and radio, connected wirelessly to your ear. When using
  your SURONIS as a communication device, it functions similar to how a
  smart-phone would. \r

  \r

  *Note: Unless you had service, your communication abilities on your SURONIS
  would be limited to only any other SURONIS within a close range of you,
  similar to a Bluetooth connection. This local connection is still vulnerable
  to jamming or other malicious activities that might happen.*\r

  \r

  **Internet Connection:** In addition to communication capabilities, your CC
  may allow you to access the Internet on your SURONIS. This allows you to
  search details of things you may encounter, such as what a certain creature
  is, how much something is worth, or a fact that you may want to know. If a
  search is particularly hard, your CC may ask you to make an Investigation
  check to see how well you can search the internet to find the answer you are
  looking for. \r

  \r

  *Note: You must have service in order to search the Internet, so you might
  not have access to it in certain remote areas, or if a jammer or other device
  was preventing you from connecting.* \r

  \r

  **Video and Photo Capabilities:** On top of everything, since your SURONIS
  acts as a phone, you may have video and photo capabilities that allow you to
  take photos, film video, live-stream, or any other number of capabilities that
  videos and pictures offer you. \r

  \r

  **Outdated SURONIS:** The current SURONIS version is v9. There were 8 other
  versions before this one, and a few of those versions are still out there for
  public use. With that in mind, your CC may choose to have you start with a
  lower-versioned SURONIS, especially if they are choosing to base the campaign
  in a year that is not part of the current era on the timeline. \r

  \r

  - *Version 2:* Version 2 of the SURONIS is a briefcase that you must have
  equipped as a weapon in order to use. Meaning, you must always have it
  equipped and if you lose your briefcase, you lose all of your belongings. \r

  - *Version 8:* Version 8 of the SURONIS only has the ability to store up to
  9 copies of the same item, because it still used a physical screen, and there
  was not enough space on the screen to allow for double digits. "
worldSummary: "*The following is a general summary of Avarice, to give you an
  idea of what kind of world it is. If you are looking for [more in-depth and
  detailed information on Avarice](/worlds/avarice), then you can find that in
  our collection of world lore. There is still a lot of lore to write, and a lot
  of it is in draft state, but everything that we have available is on our
  website for your reading pleasure, and the rest will be coming as soon as we
  can get it out.*\r

  \r

  Avarice was almost a utopia. There was a moment, after a period of seemingly
  endless war, where it appeared that everyone might be able to come to a
  consensus and unify under one flag. The invention of the Formulator, a
  molecular 3D printer with the ability to create virtually anything out of the
  molecules in the air, could have eliminated poverty, famine, war, and sickness
  overnight. Instead, Ambrosia Apparatus Incorporated bought the patent and
  privatized Formulators for their own personal use, now only leasing them out
  to others for insanely high prices or using them for grandiose acts of charity
  (which are truly just thinly-veiled marketing stunts.) \r

  \r

  The tragedy of the Formulator is not unique. Throughout the years, Avarice
  has been on the cusp of creating a paradise for its inhabitants countless
  times, only to have these humanitarian efforts destroyed by the goals and
  ambitions of the wealthy. Corpo-Nations have replaced traditional countries
  and created a society of haves and have nots. Cleverly-written tax laws,
  unfettered nepotism, unbalanced wages, and a lack of labor laws have created a
  disjointed reality. This reality mimics the social structure of feudal age
  Europe, with a powerful but small upper class overseeing a large lower class
  that struggles just to get by. Thousands die during battles over who cheated
  in a tennis match as the richest of the rich (called the Chief Officers)
  typically regard lower-class life with gross apathy. \r

  \r

  Law enforcement is controlled by the Chief Officers of various cities,
  resulting in little-to-no official police presence outside of the cities
  themselves. Instead, nomads and raiders roam the lands, pillaging whatever
  they can and returning their bounties to the warlords who they’ve pledged
  their lives to. Whether it be in the cities, or outside their walls, people’s
  lives are ever determined by the whims of vanity or the boredom of those in
  power."
