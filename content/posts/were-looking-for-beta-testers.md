Aberrations RPG is looking for beta testers who are willing to delve into the player rules and world and play in our official campaigns.

All of our campaigns are played on the world of Avarice (as it is the only world available right now).

### What do I have to do?

Beta testers must be willing to commit to a regular session, that will last no more than three hours. The regularity of the session and length of the session is determined by the campaign captain (based on your availability), with options ranging from every other week, to once a month. If you can commit to that, then we would love to have you on board!

### How do I sign up?

Follow [this link to fill out a short, less than 5 minute form](https://forms.office.com/r/q7T35gVx0r). Once you have filled it out, we will be in contact with you.

If you have more questions, feel free to email beta@aberrations-rpg.com.

**Thank you! We are excited to have you join us on this journey to get Aberrations RPG Edition 1 published.**
